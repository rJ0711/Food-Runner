# How I built it
I have build this app with the knowledge that I learned during the Internshala training of Android Application Development. I took one part at a time. First completed all the User-Interface Design using XML. Then, provided them the backbone with the Kotlin Language.

# Challenges I ran into
There is a big difference between learning and practical implementation of that learning. As I was building this app, there were many concepts that I had to go-through again. And also, there were many concepts based on the teachings but not directly related. So, covering those portions was a bit challenging for me.

# What I learned
App development was totally a new field for me to work. But while working on this project, I got a hand-on experience on working on Android Application Development using Kotlin and XML.

# What's next for this project
In this competition, the platform itself has provided the API's to use. The next step will be to learn NodeJS for Backend to develop and use my own API's.

Built With
Kotlin
XML
Android Studio
